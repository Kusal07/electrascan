                                        <h4>Research Gap</h4>
                                        <p>Research on online candidate selection systems lacks attention to ethical considerations in employing machine learning and natural language processing. There's a gap in using social media comments to predict popular candidates and election outcomes, while tailored social media campaigns for engaging young individuals in politics remain unexplored. Additionally, the unaddressed area of using machine learning and audio analysis to evaluate political promises needs attention. Bridging these gaps is crucial for ensuring ethical application, predicting elections, engaging young voters, and introducing audio analysis for transparent political commitment evaluation, ultimately enhancing the electoral process.</p>

                                        <p>Sri Lanka's democratic process is marred by deep-rooted corruption and political turmoil, prompting concerns raised by Election Commission Chairman Nimal Punchcihewa for urgent reform. The issue stems from underqualified candidates exploiting a knowledge gap in both voters and themselves, employing deceitful tactics and false promises to secure power. Media struggles to hold candidates accountable, contributing to a lack of transparency and integrity in the system. Addressing this demands immediate action to tackle corruption, underqualified candidates, voter manipulation, and the absence of mechanisms verifying candidates' credibility and promises, crucial for restoring trust and competent governance in Sri Lanka's electoral process and mitigating socio-economic repercussions.</p>
